# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Scientific Accuracy
Every factual claim must be traceable to a verifiable source. Prefer primary research from robotics, embodied cognition, biomechanics, and AI/ML. All content must be grounded in verifiable, state-of-the-art research with no hallucinated references under any circumstances.

### Academic Clarity
Write for an audience with an undergraduate-level background in computer science, robotics, or AI. Define advanced terminology before use. Content must be instructional, analytical, and research-driven with Flesch–Kincaid Grade 10–12 writing level.

### Reproducibility & Transparency
All methods, algorithms, mathematical formulations, and conceptual frameworks must be presented with enough detail to be reproducible. Each chapter must clearly state assumptions, models, and dependencies. Include symbolic definitions for all variables in mathematical formulations.

### Rigor & Peer-Review Standards
Minimum 50% peer-reviewed sources from robotics/AI conferences and journals. Prioritize sources such as: IEEE, Nature Robotics, Science Robotics, ACM, arXiv (with caution), RSS, ICRA, IROS. No claim should appear unless verified by at least one reputable source.

### Ethical & Safety Awareness
Consider ethical implications, safety constraints, societal impact, and human-robot interaction standards. No unverified claims about capabilities or dangers. Content must address ethical considerations and safety constraints in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

### Content Verification & Plagiarism Standards
Plagiarism tolerance: 0% (all text must be original). Use APA 7th edition citation format. Source types: ≥ 50% peer-reviewed academic sources; Remaining sources may include technical standards, robotics lab documentation, textbooks, reputable industry whitepapers, and specifications from leading robotics groups.

## Structural Requirements

### Book Format & Deployment
Book Format: Docusaurus-based. Deployment: GitHub Pages. Minimum Length: 20–30 full chapters. Each chapter must meet specific requirements: Learning objectives, Key definitions, Examples & illustrations, Summary, Citations section, Glossary entries where needed.

### Visual & Accessibility Standards
Non-copyright diagrams preferred. Provide descriptions of all figures for accessibility. All visuals must be original or properly licensed for educational use.

## Development Workflow

### Chapter Creation Process
Each chapter must be generated through a spec-first workflow: outline → draft → verify → revise. Use Spec-Kit Plus commands: /sp.chapter, /sp.glossary, /sp.diagram.description, /sp.proto, /sp.checklist for all content creation.

### Content Constraints
Total Word Count: 30,000–50000 words. Minimum Sources: 40+. Mathematical Accuracy: Use canonical equations from robotics, control theory, machine learning, and embodied intelligence. All factual claims must be source-verified.

## Governance

The constitution governs all content generation, review, editing, and verification across the full book creation process. All chapters and content must comply with these principles before acceptance. Any deviation from these principles requires explicit amendment to the constitution following the project governance process.
