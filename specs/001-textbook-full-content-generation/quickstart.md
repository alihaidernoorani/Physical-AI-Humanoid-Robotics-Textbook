# Quickstart Guide: Textbook Content Generation

## Overview
This guide explains how to generate complete instructional content for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook following the established blueprint and governance rules.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ installed
- Access to official ROS, NVIDIA, and OpenAI documentation
- Understanding of the target audience (advanced AI/robotics students with Python + ROS exposure)
- Familiarity with Docusaurus Markdown format

## Content Generation Workflow

### 1. Research-Concurrent Approach
Generate content while validating technology versions and standards:
- Use ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill (LTS) as the primary ROS 2 distribution
- Reference Isaac Sim 2024+ for simulation content
- Use Jetson Orin Nano as the primary hardware platform (mention AGX for advanced setups)
- Validate all technical claims against official documentation

### 2. Module-by-Module Generation
Follow this sequence to maintain logical progression:

**Foundation Phase (Modules 1-2)**:
1. Module 1: ROS 2 nervous system (real-time control, node architecture, humanoid URDF)
2. Module 2: Digital twin (physics simulation, sensor modeling, Gazebo/Unity interoperability)

**Integration Phase (Module 3)**:
3. Module 3: AI-Robot brain (Isaac Sim synthetic data, hardware-accelerated perception, Nav2 for bipeds)

**Synthesis Phase (Module 4)**:
4. Module 4: VLA (Voice-to-action, LLM-based task planning, capstone integration)

### 3. Chapter Structure Template
Each chapter must follow this structure:

```markdown
---
id: [unique-id]
title: [chapter-title]
description: [seo description]
personalization: true
translation: ur
learning_outcomes:
  - [learning objective 1]
  - [learning objective 2]
  - [learning objective 3]
  - [learning objective 4]
  - [learning objective 5]
software_stack:
  - [technology 1]
  - [technology 2]
[additional frontmatter as needed]
---

# [Chapter Title]

## Learning Objectives

- [3-5 specific, measurable learning objectives]

## [Main Content Sections]

[Conceptual explanations with graduate-level technical depth]

## Key Takeaways

- [Summary of key concepts]
- [Connection to capstone project]
- [Forward references to later modules]

## References

[APA 7th edition citations]
```

### 4. Generation Steps
1. **Select a chapter** from the existing file structure
2. **Research current information** about the topic from official sources
3. **Write conceptual explanations** focusing on understanding rather than implementation
4. **Include concrete examples** of ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, or VLA usage
5. **Add forward references** to capstone project and later modules
6. **Verify compliance** with all constraints (no code blocks, preserve frontmatter, etc.)
7. **Validate technical accuracy** against official documentation

### 5. Quality Validation Checklist
Before moving to the next chapter, ensure each chapter meets:
- [ ] 3-5 clear learning objectives
- [ ] Conceptual explanations with graduate-level depth
- [ ] Concrete examples of ROS 2/Gazebo/Isaac/VLA usage
- [ ] No code blocks or implementation commands
- [ ] "Key Takeaways" summary included
- [ ] Forward references to capstone project and later modules
- [ ] Frontmatter preserved (personalization: true, translation: ur)
- [ ] Content scaffolds the Autonomous Humanoid capstone
- [ ] Uses 2024-2025 technology standards (Jetson Orin Nano, Isaac Sim 2024+, etc.)
- [ ] Scientific accuracy verified against official sources
- [ ] Academic clarity appropriate for target audience

## Best Practices

### Content Creation
- Focus on intuition over mathematical formalism (with optional formal asides)
- Use active voice and concise prose
- Define advanced terminology before use
- Include symbolic definitions for all variables in mathematical formulations
- Maintain consistent tone and depth across all chapters

### Technical Accuracy
- Verify all technical claims against official documentation
- Use primary research from robotics, embodied cognition, biomechanics, and AI/ML
- Prioritize sources from IEEE, Nature Robotics, Science Robotics, RSS, ICRA, IROS
- Include APA 7th edition citations for all sources

### Educational Effectiveness
- Assume reader has completed prerequisite chapters
- Build knowledge progressively from foundation to synthesis
- Connect concepts across modules to reinforce learning
- Include real-world applications and use cases
- Address ethical implications and safety constraints where relevant

## Deployment
Once all chapters are complete:
1. Run `npm run build` to build the Docusaurus site
2. Verify all links and cross-references work correctly
3. Test the site locally with `npm start`
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages following the existing workflow
