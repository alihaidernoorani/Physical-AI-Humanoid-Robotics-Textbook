## Dependencies

### User Story Completion Order
1. **User Story 1** (Complete Textbook Content Generation) - Foundation for all other stories
2. **User Story 2** (Consistent Educational Experience) - Depends on US1 content being written
3. **User Story 3** (Future-Ready Content) - Can run in parallel with US1 but final validation after US1

### Critical Path
- T001 → T002 → T003 → T004 → T005 → T006-T026 (parallel) → T027 → T028-T032 (parallel) → T034-T036 (parallel) → T037-T048 (parallel)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Chapters within each module can be written in parallel (T006-T011, T012-T016, T017-T021, T022-T026)
- Quality assurance tasks can run in parallel after content is written (T028-T048)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (User Story 1)
- Complete content for Module 1 (ROS 2 nervous system) as proof of concept
- Validate chapter structure with learning objectives, conceptual explanations, and key takeaways
- Confirm frontmatter preservation and no code blocks

### Incremental Delivery
1. Foundation (Modules 1-2): Core concepts and simulation
2. Integration (Module 3): AI and perception systems
3. Synthesis (Module 4): VLA integration and capstone project
4. Quality assurance and validation across all modules
