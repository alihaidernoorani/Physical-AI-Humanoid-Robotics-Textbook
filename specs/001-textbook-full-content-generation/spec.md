# Feature Specification: Textbook Full Content Generation

**Feature Branch**: `001-textbook-full-content-generation`
**Created**: 2025-12-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Generate the complete instructional content for **all chapters** of the *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics* textbook, following the existing blueprint structure in the `docs/` folder and the governance rules in `constitution.md`.

**Context**:
- This is **Phase 2**: full content generation (blueprint already deployed on GitHub Pages)
- Target audience: advanced AI/robotics students with Python + ROS exposure
- Total scope: **4 modules, 21 chapters** as defined in the course outline
- All chapters must support future **better-auth personalization** and **Urdu translation**

**Required Content per Chapter**:
- Clear learning objectives (3–5 bullet points)
- Conceptual explanations (graduate-level technical depth)
- Concrete examples of **ROS 2 / Gazebo / Isaac / VLA usage**
- **No code blocks** (unless allowed by constitution) — focus on **narrative, workflows, and system understanding**
- "Key Takeaways" summary
- Forward references to capstone project and later modules

**Success Criteria**:
- Every chapter scaffolds the **Autonomous Humanoid capstone**
- All hardware/tool references use **2024–2025 standards** (Jetson Orin Nano, Isaac Sim 2024+, etc.)
- Language is **precise, consistent, and GitHub Pages–compatible Markdown**
- **Frontmatter preserved** in every file (`personalization: true`, `translation: ur`)

**Constraints**:
- **Do not alter file names or folder structure**
- **No RAG, chatbot, or auth logic** — pure textbook content only
- **No vendor comparisons, ethics, or implementation commands** (e.g., "run this")
- **No external links** except to official ROS/NVIDIA docs

**Output**: Full content for every chapter file in `docs/`, ready for review and deployment."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete Textbook Content Generation (Priority: P1)

An advanced AI/robotics student accesses the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook and finds comprehensive, well-structured content across all 4 modules and 21 chapters that provides deep conceptual understanding of ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, and VLA systems.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - providing complete educational content that enables students to learn advanced robotics concepts effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that each chapter file contains complete educational content with learning objectives, conceptual explanations, and examples, delivering a comprehensive learning experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student wants to learn about Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, **When** they access any chapter in the textbook, **Then** they find complete, well-structured educational content with learning objectives, conceptual explanations, and examples.

2. **Given** the textbook exists with incomplete content, **When** the content generation is completed, **Then** every chapter file in the docs/ directory contains full educational content meeting the specified requirements.

---

### User Story 2 - Consistent Educational Experience (Priority: P2)

A student studying different modules throughout the textbook experiences consistent content quality, depth, and structure that scaffolds their understanding toward the Autonomous Humanoid capstone project.

**Why this priority**: Consistency across all modules ensures students can build knowledge progressively without jarring changes in content style or depth.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reviewing multiple chapters to verify consistent content structure, educational depth, and adherence to the specified requirements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student reading multiple chapters across different modules, **When** they compare content quality and structure, **Then** they find consistent educational depth, formatting, and approach.

---

### User Story 3 - Future-Ready Content (Priority: P3)

An educator or student in 2024-2025 accesses the textbook and finds content that references current hardware and software standards (Jetson Orin Nano, Isaac Sim 2024+, etc.) that remains relevant for the target timeframe.

**Why this priority**: Using current standards ensures the content remains relevant and practical for students learning on contemporary platforms.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that all hardware and software references in the content align with 2024-2025 standards as specified.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student learning with current hardware/software platforms, **When** they read content referencing specific technologies, **Then** those references align with 2024-2025 standards (Jetson Orin Nano, Isaac Sim 2024+, etc.).

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a chapter requires content that doesn't fit the standard format?
- How does the system handle chapters that may need additional specialized diagrams or visual aids?
