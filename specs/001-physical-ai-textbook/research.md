# Research: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Blueprint

## Docusaurus Implementation Research

### Decision: Docusaurus v3.9 for Static Site Generation
**Rationale**: Docusaurus is a mature, React-based static site generator optimized for documentation. It provides built-in features like search, versioning, and navigation that are essential for textbook content. The v3.9 version offers the latest features and security updates for 2024-2025 academic use.

**Alternatives considered**:
- GitBook: More limited customization options and less flexible for academic content
- Hugo: Requires more technical knowledge for content management
- Custom React site: Higher maintenance overhead without additional benefits

### Decision: GitHub Pages for Deployment
**Rationale**: GitHub Pages provides free, reliable hosting with custom domain support. It integrates seamlessly with the repository workflow and provides good performance for static documentation sites. Perfect for academic institutions with budget constraints.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Netlify/Vercel: Additional complexity for simple documentation site
- Self-hosted: Unnecessary overhead for static content
- Institutional servers: May not be available or accessible to all institutions

## File Structure Research

### Decision: Numbered Directory Structure for Module Ordering
**Rationale**: Numbered directories (01-04) ensure clear sequential ordering of modules that matches the 13-week course flow. This prevents confusion about the intended learning sequence and makes the structure self-documenting.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Alphabetical ordering: Could result in incorrect module sequence (e.g., "Digital Twin" before "ROS2 Nervous System")
- Unnumbered directories: Would rely on alphabetical sorting which doesn't match the intended learning progression

### Decision: Frontmatter Metadata for Extensibility
**Rationale**: YAML frontmatter in each Markdown file allows for future extensibility with features like personalization, translation, and assessment tracking without affecting the core content structure.

**Alternatives considered**:
- No metadata: Would require restructuring later when adding personalization features
- Separate config files: Would add complexity and make per-page customization harder

## Navigation and Organization Research

### Decision: 3-6 Chapters per Module with 2-5 Subtopics Each
**Rationale**: This structure aligns with the 13-week course flow while providing sufficient granularity for weekly lesson planning. The range allows flexibility for modules that may require more or less detail based on complexity.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed number of chapters/subtopics: Would not allow for appropriate depth variation between modules
- Single large file per module: Would be unwieldy and difficult to navigate

## Accessibility and Standards Research

### Decision: APA 7th Edition Citation Format Support
**Rationale**: APA 7th edition is the standard for academic writing in technical fields. The structure must accommodate proper citation formatting for peer-reviewed sources as required by the constitution.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Other citation formats: Would not meet academic standards required by target audience
- No citation structure: Would violate constitution requirements for academic rigor

### Decision: Frontmatter Fields for Academic Requirements
**Rationale**: Including fields like learning_outcomes, prerequisites, and assessment_recommendations in frontmatter ensures these academic requirements are consistently included in each module/chapter as specified in the functional requirements.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Hardcoded content sections: Would be less flexible and harder to process programmatically
- No structured metadata: Would make it difficult to generate summary pages or validate academic requirements
