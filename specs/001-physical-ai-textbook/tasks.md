# Tasks: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Blueprint

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No test tasks included as this is a structural blueprint only (no functionality to test)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Docusaurus project**: `docs/`, `src/`, `package.json`, `docusaurus.config.js` at repository root
- **Content files**: `docs/01-ros2-nervous-system/`, `docs/02-digital-twin/`, `docs/03-ai-robot-brain/`, `docs/04-vla/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Docusaurus project initialization and basic configuration

- [X] T001 Initialize Docusaurus v3.9 project in repository root
- [X] T002 Configure docusaurus.config.js with textbook settings
- [X] T003 [P] Install gh-pages dependency for GitHub Pages deployment

---
## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core content structure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Create docs/ directory structure with 4 module folders
- [X] T005 [P] Create module intro files with basic frontmatter in each module directory
- [X] T006 [P] Create GitHub Pages deployment configuration

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Academic Course Outline Generation (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Generate a comprehensive textbook blueprint for academic instructors with 4 modules, chapters, and subtopics that match the 13-week course flow

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the complete outline with all 4 modules, chapters, and subtopics exists and matches the expected 13-week course flow

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T007 [P] [US1] Create Module 1 chapters in docs/01-ros2-nervous-system/ with proper frontmatter
- [X] T008 [P] [US1] Create Module 2 chapters in docs/02-digital-twin/ with proper frontmatter
- [X] T009 [P] [US1] Create Module 3 chapters in docs/03-ai-robot-brain/ with proper frontmatter
- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Create Module 4 chapters in docs/04-vla/ with proper frontmatter
- [X] T011 [US1] Add learning outcomes to all module intro files
- [X] T012 [US1] Add software stack recommendations to all module intro files
- [X] T013 [US1] Add hardware recommendations to all module intro files
- [X] T014 [US1] Add hardware alternatives to all module intro files

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Docusaurus Site Architecture Planning (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Structure the blueprint to be compatible with Docusaurus features like navigation and search for efficient documentation page creation

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the subtopics in the outline are concrete enough to become individual Docusaurus documentation pages and that the structure accommodates core Docusaurus features

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T015 [P] [US2] Add proper H2/H3 heading structure to all chapter files
- [X] T016 [P] [US2] Add navigation-friendly IDs to all chapter files
- [X] T017 [US2] Create _category_.json files for each module directory
- [X] T018 [US2] Update main _category_.json in docs/ directory
- [X] T019 [US2] Add search-related metadata to all frontmatter

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Technology Stack Documentation (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Include comprehensive technology stack information for each module so students can prepare their development environment appropriately

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that each module includes clearly specified software stack and hardware recommendations reflecting 2024-2025 academic/industry standards, with budget-conscious alternatives provided

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T020 [US3] Add prerequisite knowledge statements to all module intro files
- [X] T021 [US3] Add assessment recommendations to all module intro files
- [X] T022 [US3] Add module dependencies information to all module intro files
- [X] T023 [US3] Add estimated duration information to all chapter files
- [X] T024 [US3] Add extensibility hooks (personalization, translation) to all frontmatter

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [X] T025 [P] Add consistent frontmatter across all files with extensibility hooks
- [X] T026 [P] Validate all file paths and links in the structure
- [X] T027 [P] Update package.json with deploy script
- [X] T028 [P] Add README documentation for the textbook structure
- [X] T029 Run validation to ensure all requirements from spec are met

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all Module 1 chapters together:
Task: "Create Module 1 chapters in docs/01-ros2-nervous-system/ with proper frontmatter"
Task: "Create Module 2 chapters in docs/02-digital-twin/ with proper frontmatter"
Task: "Create Module 3 chapters in docs/03-ai-robot-brain/ with proper frontmatter"
Task: "Create Module 4 chapters in docs/04-vla/ with proper frontmatter"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
