# Feature Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Blueprint

**Feature Branch**: `001-physical-ai-textbook`
**Created**: 2025-12-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – Textbook Blueprint

**Goal**:
Generate a complete, production-ready **book outline** (no content) for a Docusaurus-based textbook aligned with the official 4-module capstone course on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This blueprint will directly drive chapter authoring, site architecture, and eventual deployment to **GitHub Pages**.

**Target audience**:
Advanced undergraduate or graduate students in AI/robotics with prior experience in Python, Linux, and basic machine learning. They are preparing to build embodied AI systems using industry-standard robotics frameworks.

**Course theme**:
\"AI Systems in the Physical World: Embodied Intelligence\" — bridging digital AI models with physical humanoid agents in simulation and reality.

**Required output**:
A hierarchical Markdown outline containing:
- 4 top-level modules (as defined below)
- 3–6 chapters per module
- 2–5 clearly named subtopics per chapter
- For each module:
  • 3–5 measurable learning outcomes
  • Core software stack (e.g., ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo Harmonic, NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2024+, Unity Robotics)
  • Recommended hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, Intel RealSense, etc.)
  • Dependencies on prior modules

**Module definitions (must use these exact titles and focus areas)**:

**Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**
Focus: Middleware for real-time robot control
- ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Writing ROS 2 agents in Python (rclpy)
- URDF for humanoid kinematic modeling
- Lifecycle nodes and composition

**Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**
Focus: Physics-based simulation and human-robot interaction
- Rigid body dynamics, gravity, and collision in Gazebo
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, RGB-D cameras, IMUs)
- High-fidelity environments in Unity with ROS 2 integration
- Synchronizing Gazebo and Unity for hybrid simulation

**Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)**
Focus: Perception, navigation, and hardware-accelerated AI
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS GEMs: VSLAM, object detection, and depth estimation
- Nav2 stack for bipedal path planning and recovery behaviors
- Real-time inference on edge devices (Jetson)

**Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**
Focus: Multimodal reasoning for autonomous humanoids
- Voice-to-text with Whisper (local or cloud)
- LLM-based task decomposition (e.g., \"Clean the room\" → pick, place, avoid)
- Grounding language in ROS 2 action servers
- Capstone: End-to-end autonomous humanoid in simulation (voice → plan → navigate → perceive → act)

**Success criteria**:
✅ Outline mirrors the official 12–16 week course flow
✅ Each chapter maps to ~1 week of instruction
✅ Subtopics are concrete enough to become individual Docusaurus documentation pages
✅ Tools/hardware reflect 2024–2025 academic/industry standards
✅ Capstone project is scaffolded across Modules 1–4
✅ Structure assumes **static site deployment via GitHub Pages** (no server-side logic)

**Constraints**:
- Format: **Pure Markdown** (h2/h3 headings, bullet lists only)
- **No prose, explanations, code, or examples**—structure only
- Do not invent new modules or deviate from the 4 given themes
- Avoid ethics, history, or vendor comparisons
- All content must be **static and self-contained** (GitHub Pages compatible)

**Not building**:
- Chapter content, tutorials, or concept explanations
- Code snippets, CLI commands, or config files
- Assessments, quizzes, or grading rubrics
- Marketing language or motivational text

**Specify+ note**:
This blueprint will be used to generate individual /sp.specify prompts per chapter. Structure must enable modular, parallel content development for a Docusaurus site deployed on **GitHub Pages**."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*



### User Story 1 - Academic Course Outline Generation (Priority: P1)

As an academic instructor, I want to generate a comprehensive textbook blueprint for a Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course so that I can structure my curriculum around industry-standard tools and provide students with a clear learning pathway.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that directly addresses the main goal of creating a textbook blueprint aligned with a 4-module capstone course.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating the complete outline with all 4 modules, chapters, and subtopics, and verifying it matches the expected 12-16 week course flow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a request for a Physical AI textbook blueprint, **When** the system processes the requirements, **Then** it produces a hierarchical Markdown outline with 4 modules, 3-6 chapters per module, and 2-5 subtopics per chapter
2. **Given** the blueprint is generated, **When** I review the structure, **Then** I can see clear learning outcomes, software stack recommendations, and hardware requirements for each module

---

### User Story 2 - Docusaurus Site Architecture Planning (Priority: P2)

As a textbook development team member, I want the blueprint to be structured for Docusaurus deployment so that we can efficiently create individual documentation pages that will work well in a static site generator.

**Why this priority**: This ensures the blueprint can be effectively converted into actual content pages for the GitHub Pages deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the subtopics in the outline are concrete enough to become individual Docusaurus documentation pages and that the structure accommodates core Docusaurus features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the textbook blueprint, **When** I examine the subtopic structure, **Then** each subtopic is specific enough to be developed as an independent documentation page
2. **Given** the blueprint structure, **When** I review it for Docusaurus compatibility, **Then** it accommodates core features like navigation and search

---

### User Story 3 - Technology Stack Documentation (Priority: P3)

As a student preparing to work with embodied AI systems, I want to understand the recommended software and hardware stack for each module so that I can prepare my development environment appropriately.

**Why this priority**: This provides practical value to the target audience by giving them concrete technology recommendations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that each module includes clearly specified software stack and hardware recommendations reflecting 2024-2025 academic/industry standards, with budget-conscious alternatives provided.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the blueprint with technology recommendations, **When** I review each module, **Then** I can identify the specific software tools and hardware components recommended for that module
2. **Given** budget constraints, **When** I review the hardware recommendations, **Then** I can identify budget-conscious alternatives for major components

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the module dependencies create circular requirements between modules?
- How does the system handle changes to the 4-module structure if course requirements evolve?
