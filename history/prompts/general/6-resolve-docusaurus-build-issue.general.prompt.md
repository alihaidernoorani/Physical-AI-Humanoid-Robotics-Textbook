## Prompt

Help me continue with npm run build as it was failing due to issues with Docusaurus configuration. The build was failing with errors related to document IDs not matching between the sidebar configuration and actual documents.

## Response snapshot

Successfully resolved the Docusaurus build failure by addressing multiple configuration issues:

1. Fixed sidebar configuration in sidebars.ts to use the correct document IDs without numeric prefixes (e.g., ros2-nervous-system/intro instead of 01-ros2-nervous-system/intro)

2. Updated broken links in docusaurus.config.ts that were pointing to old document paths with numeric prefixes

3. Fixed homepage link in src/pages/index.tsx from /docs/intro to /docs/ros2-nervous-system/intro

4. Created a root intro document docs/intro.md to satisfy the broken link from the homepage

All document IDs in the markdown files were using the format without numeric prefixes, but the sidebar configuration and other links were referencing the paths with prefixes, causing the build to fail with broken link errors. The fixes ensure all references now match the actual document IDs.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Fixed Docusaurus build failure that was caused by mismatched document IDs and broken links
- 🧪 Tests: docusaurus build now completes successfully
- 📁 Files: Modified 4 files to fix configuration issues
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now successfully run npm run build
- 🧠 Reflection: The issue was a configuration mismatch between document IDs and references in sidebar, config, and homepage

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Build failure due to broken links and mismatched document IDs
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Build now passes
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Troubleshooting prompt
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - issue resolved
