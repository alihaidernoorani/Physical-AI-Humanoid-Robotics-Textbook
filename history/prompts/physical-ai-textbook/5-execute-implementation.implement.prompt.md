## Prompt

sp.implement is running… Execute all tasks in tasks.md to produce a structural blueprint only for the Docusaurus textbook Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

## Response snapshot

Executing all tasks in tasks.md to produce a structural blueprint only for the Docusaurus textbook Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This includes:

1. Creating the Docusaurus project structure
2. Configuring docusaurus.config.ts with textbook settings
3. Installing gh-pages dependency for GitHub Pages deployment
4. Creating docs/ directory structure with 4 module folders
5. Creating module intro files with basic frontmatter in each module directory
6. Creating GitHub Pages deployment configuration
7. Creating Module 1-4 chapters with proper frontmatter
8. Adding learning outcomes, software stack, hardware recommendations to all module intro files
9. Adding proper H2/H3 heading structure to all chapter files
10. Adding navigation-friendly IDs to all chapter files
11. Creating _category_.json files for each module directory
12. Updating main _category_.json in docs/ directory
13. Adding search-related metadata to all frontmatter
14. Adding prerequisite knowledge statements, assessment recommendations, module dependencies
15. Adding estimated duration information to all chapter files
16. Adding extensibility hooks (personalization, translation) to all frontmatter
17. Adding consistent frontmatter across all files with extensibility hooks
18. Validating all file paths and links in the structure
19. Updating package.json with deploy script
20. Adding README documentation for the textbook structure
21. Running validation to ensure all requirements from spec are met

The implementation successfully created the complete structural blueprint with all 4 modules (ROS 2 Nervous System, Digital Twin, AI-Robot Brain, VLA), each with appropriate chapters and subtopics following the 13-week course flow. All files include proper frontmatter with learning outcomes, software stack, hardware recommendations, and alternatives. Extensibility hooks for personalization and Urdu translation are implemented throughout.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete structural blueprint for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook created with all 4 modules and chapters
- 🧪 Tests: All tasks from tasks.md completed successfully
- 📁 Files: Created Docusaurus structure with 4 modules, intro files, chapter files, and navigation configuration
- 🔁 Next prompts: Content development phase could begin after this structural foundation
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation followed the spec requirements precisely, creating a solid foundation for future content development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all implementation tasks completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All tasks marked as completed in tasks.md
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation command
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin content development for individual chapters
