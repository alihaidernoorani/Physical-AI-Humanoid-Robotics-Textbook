## Prompt

```text
Create a technical and architectural plan for the **blueprint-only phase** of a Docusaurus-based textbook titled *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics*, to be deployed to GitHub Pages.

**Deliverable**: A specification-ready plan that enables generation of a pure structural outline (Markdown hierarchy) for Docusaurus—**no chapter content, code, or prose**.

---

### Architecture Sketch
- **Static Site**: Docusaurus v3.9, deployed via GitHub Pages (client-side only, no backend)
- **Modular Structure**: 4 top-level modules → chapters → subtopics, matching the official 13-week course
- **Extensibility Hooks**: Reserve slots in Docusaurus metadata/layout for:
  - Per-chapter personalization button (linked to user profile from better-auth)
  - Per-chapter Urdu translation toggle
- **Auth Integration Point**: Plan for `better-auth`–powered user context (background survey at signup) to drive personalization logic later—blueprint must anticipate user-state awareness via metadata

---

### Section Structure Strategy
- **Top-Level**: `docs/` root with 4 directories:
  `01-ros2-nervous-system/`,
  `02-digital-twin/`,
  `03-ai-robot-brain/`,
  `04-vla/`
- **Per Module**:
  - `intro.md` (module overview)
  - 3–6 chapter `.md` files (e.g., `01-ros2-nodes.md`)
  - Each chapter contains 2–5 subtopics as H2/H3 headings
- **Metadata**: Frontmatter in every `.md` file to support future features:
  ```yaml

## Response snapshot

Generated a comprehensive implementation plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Blueprint. The plan includes:

- **Technical Context**: Docusaurus v3.9 with Markdown files for GitHub Pages deployment
- **Constitution Check**: All constitution requirements verified and marked as satisfied
- **Project Structure**: Detailed directory structure with 4 modules and proper numbering
- **Research Document**: Technology decisions and rationale for Docusaurus, GitHub Pages, and file structure
- **Data Model**: Entity definitions for Module, Chapter, Subtopic, and Course entities with validation rules
- **Quickstart Guide**: Step-by-step setup and implementation instructions
- **API Contracts**: Structure interface definitions with validation requirements and extensibility hooks

The plan ensures compliance with all constitution requirements including scientific accuracy, academic clarity, reproducibility, and deployment requirements. All requirements from the specification are addressed with proper extensibility hooks for future personalization and translation features.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete technical architecture for textbook blueprint
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/blueprint-structure.yaml
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task generation with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan addresses all constitution requirements and extensibility needs

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Generate implementation tasks with /sp.tasks
