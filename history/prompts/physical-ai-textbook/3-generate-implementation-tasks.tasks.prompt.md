## Prompt

```text
Break down the implementation plan into a clear, actionable checklist of tasks to produce a **structural blueprint only** (no chapter content) for the Docusaurus textbook *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics*.

**Context**:
- Repository already exists: https://github.com/alihaidernoorani/Physical-AI-Humanoid-Robotics-Textbook
- Spec-Kit Plus is already initialized (do **not** run `sp init`)
- The book will be deployed to **GitHub Pages**
- Future features: better-auth (user signup with background survey), per-chapter personalization, and Urdu translation
- **RAG chatbot will be added later—do not include any RAG-related tasks**

**Deliverable**: A clean, executable checklist that creates a Docusaurus-ready folder and file structure with metadata hooks for future features.

Organize tasks into the following sections:

---

### Docusaurus Setup
- [ ] Install Docusaurus v3.9 in the project root:
  `npx create-docusaurus@latest docs physical-ai-book --typescript`
- [ ] Replace default Docusaurus template with the classic/docs preset
- [ ] Configure `docusaurus.config.js`:
  - Set `title: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"`
  - Set `url: "https://alihaidernoorani.github.io"`
  - Set `baseUrl: "/Physical-AI-Humanoid-Robotics-Textbook/"`
  - Set `organizationName: "alihaidernoorani"`
  - Set `projectName: "Physical-AI-Humanoid-Robotics-Textbook"`

### GitHub Pages Deployment
- [ ] Install `gh-pages`: `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`
- [ ] Add to `package.json`: `"deploy": "docusaurus deploy"`
- [ ] In GitHub repo settings, enable GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch

### Content Framework (Blueprint Only)
- [ ] Create `docs/` with 4 module folders:
  `01-ros2-nervous-system/`
  `02-digital-twin/`
  `03-ai-robot-brain/`
  `04-vla/`
- [ ] In each module, create:
  - `intro.md` (module overview placeholder)
  - One `.md` file per chapter (e.g., `01-ros2-nodes.md`) based on the official course outline
- [ ] In every `.md` file, add frontmatter with future-feature hooks:
  ```yaml

  id: unique-chapter-id
  title: "Chapter Title"

  translation: ur

## Response snapshot

Generated a comprehensive task list (specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/tasks.md) for implementing the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook blueprint. The tasks are organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3) to enable independent implementation and testing.

The task list includes:
- Phase 1: Setup tasks for Docusaurus initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks for the content structure
- Phase 3: User Story 1 implementation (Academic Course Outline Generation)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 implementation (Docusaurus Site Architecture)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 implementation (Technology Stack Documentation)
- Phase 6: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

Each task follows the required format with IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1, US2, US3]. The tasks are organized to support both sequential MVP delivery and parallel team development.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created executable task list for blueprint implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task execution phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Task organization enables independent user story implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin executing tasks in Phase 1
