## Prompt

Generate the complete instructional content for **all chapters** of the *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics* textbook, following the existing blueprint structure in the `docs/` folder and the governance rules in `constitution.md`.

**Context**:
- This is **Phase 2**: full content generation (blueprint already deployed on GitHub Pages)
- Target audience: advanced AI/robotics students with Python + ROS exposure
- Total scope: **4 modules, ~16 chapters** as defined in the course outline
- All chapters must support future **better-auth personalization** and **Urdu translation**

**Required Content per Chapter**:
- Clear learning objectives (3–5 bullet points)
- Conceptual explanations (graduate-level technical depth)
- Concrete examples of **ROS 2 / Gazebo / Isaac / VLA usage**
- **No code blocks** (unless allowed by constitution) — focus on **narrative, workflows, and system understanding**
- "Key Takeaways" summary
- Forward references to capstone project and later modules

**Success Criteria**:
- Every chapter scaffolds the **Autonomous Humanoid capstone**
- All hardware/tool references use **2024–2025 standards** (Jetson Orin Nano, Isaac Sim 2024+, etc.)
- Language is **precise, consistent, and GitHub Pages–compatible Markdown**
- **Frontmatter preserved** in every file (`personalization: true`, `translation: ur`)

**Constraints**:
- **Do not alter file names or folder structure**
- **No RAG, chatbot, or auth logic** — pure textbook content only
- **No vendor comparisons, ethics, or implementation commands** (e.g., "run this")
- **No external links** except to official ROS/NVIDIA docs

**Output**: Full content for every chapter file in `docs/`, ready for review and deployment.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for the textbook content generation feature, including:

- User stories prioritized by importance (P1-P3)
- Functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-012) defining what the system must do
- Key entities identified (Textbook Chapter, Module, Learning Objective, Frontmatter)
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes (SC-001 to SC-005)
- Edge cases consideration
- Quality checklist validation

The specification captures the need to generate complete educational content for all 4 modules (~16 chapters) while maintaining consistency, using current technology standards, and preserving existing file structure.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created detailed specification for textbook content generation
- 🧪 Tests: Specification validated against quality criteria
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification captures complete scope of textbook content generation with measurable success criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification complete and validated
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all quality criteria met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Feature specification prompt
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase
