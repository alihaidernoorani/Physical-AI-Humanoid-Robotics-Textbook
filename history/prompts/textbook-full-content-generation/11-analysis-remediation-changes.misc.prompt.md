## Prompt

Make the recommended changes as provided by /sp.analyze

## Response snapshot

Implemented the recommended changes from the /sp.analyze report to address constitution alignment issues and inconsistencies:

1. Updated the spec to reflect the correct chapter count (21 chapters instead of ~16)
2. Added constitution-mandated requirements to the spec:
   - FR-013: ≥50% peer-reviewed sources requirement
   - FR-014: APA 7th edition citation format requirement
   - FR-015: Ethical implications and safety considerations requirement
   - FR-016: 0% plagiarism tolerance requirement

3. Updated all chapter writing tasks to include constitution requirements:
   - Each task now explicitly mentions including ≥50% peer-reviewed sources
   - Each task now explicitly mentions APA 7th edition citations
   - Each task now explicitly mentions ethical considerations

4. Added a specific task for handling edge cases related to diagrams and visual aids (T048)

These changes ensure full alignment with the project constitution regarding scientific accuracy, academic clarity, reproducibility, rigor, ethical awareness, and content verification standards.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Full constitution alignment achieved across spec and tasks
- 🧪 Tests: Requirements now properly mapped to implementation tasks
- 📁 Files: Updated spec.md and tasks.md to include constitution requirements
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation with constitution-compliant requirements
- 🧠 Reflection: Analysis findings successfully remediated with explicit constitution requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all constitution requirements now explicitly covered
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - constitution alignment achieved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Analysis remediation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with implementation using constitution-compliant tasks
