## Prompt

Based on the course outline and the current Docusaurus blueprint in docs/, confirm:
- How many total chapters exist across all 4 modules?
- Does the structure include one intro.md per module?
- Is there a top-level landing page (e.g., docs/intro.md or docs/index.md) that introduces all 4 modules?

Do not add new features—only verify what's already specified.

## Response snapshot

Verified the course structure by examining the docs/ directory:

- Total chapters: 21 across all 4 modules (including 4 intro chapters, one per module)
- Each module has an intro.md file:
  - docs/01-ros2-nervous-system/intro.md
  - docs/02-digital-twin/intro.md
  - docs/03-ai-robot-brain/intro.md
  - docs/04-vla/intro.md
- There is a top-level docs/intro.md serving as a landing page that introduces all 4 modules

No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification. The specification is clear and ready to proceed to the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Verified textbook structure with 21 total chapters across 4 modules
- 🧪 Tests: Structure verification completed
- 📁 Files: Examined all module directories and intro files
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: No clarifications needed - structure is clearly defined in existing files

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - structure clearly defined
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all questions answered
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Structure verification prompt
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase
