## Prompt

Break down the content generation plan into a clear, actionable checklist of tasks for writing **all textbook chapters** across the 4 modules.

**Scope**: Only tasks required to produce **instructional Markdown content** for existing `.md` files in `docs/`.
**Do not modify structure, frontmatter, or metadata**—only fill chapter bodies.

**Requirements**:
1. Follow the **module sequence**: Foundation (Modules 1–2) → Integration (Module 3) → Synthesis (Module 4)
2. Use **research-concurrent writing**: validate tool versions (e.g., ROS 2 Humble, Isaac Sim 2024+) during drafting
3. Every chapter must include:
   - 3–5 learning objectives (bullet points)
   - Conceptual explanations (graduate-level, no fluff)
   - Forward references to capstone project
   - "Key Takeaways" summary
4. Preserve frontmatter (`personalization: true`, `translation: ur`) in every file
5. **No code blocks, CLI commands, or implementation instructions**—this is a textbook, not a lab manual

**Organize tasks into the following sections**:

---

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- [ ] Write `01-ros2-nodes.md`: ROS 2 architecture, topics, services, actions
- [ ] Write `02-rclpy-agents.md`: Bridging Python AI agents to ROS controllers
- [ ] Write `03-humanoid-urdf.md`: Unified Robot Description Format for humanoids
- [ ] Write `04-lifecycle-nodes.md`: Managed node lifecycles and composition
- [ ] Write `intro.md`: Module overview and learning map

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- [ ] Write `01-gazebo-physics.md`: Rigid body dynamics, gravity, collisions
- [ ] Write `02-sensor-simulation.md`: LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs in simulation
- [ ] Write `03-unity-robotics.md`: High-fidelity rendering and HRI in Unity
- [ ] Write `04-hybrid-sim.md`: Synchronizing Gazebo and Unity workflows
- [ ] Write `intro.md`: Module overview and learning map

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- [ ] Write `01-isaac-sim.md`: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data
- [ ] Write `02-isaac-ros.md`: Hardware-accelerated VSLAM and perception
- [ ] Write `03-nav2-humanoids.md`: Path planning for bipedal locomotion
- [ ] Write `04-edge-deployment.md`: Deploying AI models to Jetson Orin Nano
- [ ] Write `intro.md`: Module overview and learning map

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- [ ] Write `01-whisper-integration.md`: Voice-to-text for robot commands
- [ ] Write `02-llm-task-planning.md`: Translating "Clean the room" into action sequences
- [ ] Write `03-ros-action-grounding.md`: Connecting LLM outputs to ROS 2 action servers
- [ ] Write `04-autonomous-humanoid.md`: Capstone project walkthrough
- [ ] Write `intro.md`: Module overview and learning map

### Top-Level Book Content
- [ ] Write `docs/intro.md`: Main landing page with book theme, 4-module overview, and "Start Learning" call-to-action

### Quality Assurance & Validation
- [ ] Verify every chapter uses **2024–2025 tool names** (Jetson Orin Nano, Isaac Sim 2024+, ROS 2 Humble)
- [ ] Confirm **no code blocks or CLI commands** appear in any chapter
- [ ] Ensure **frontmatter is preserved** (no accidental edits to `id`, `title`, `personalization`, `translation`)
- [ ] Check that **capstone project is scaffolded** across all modules
- [ ] Validate tone and depth consistency with `constitution.md`

Output this as a clean, copy-pasteable checklist. Do not include explanations or commentary.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive task breakdown for textbook content generation with 48 specific tasks organized across 6 phases:

- **Phase 1**: Setup & Environment (3 tasks)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational Content Structure (2 tasks)
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Complete Textbook Content Generation (P1) (22 tasks)
- **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - Consistent Educational Experience (P2) (6 tasks)
- **Phase 5**: User Story 3 - Future-Ready Content (P3) (3 tasks)
- **Phase 6**: Quality Assurance & Validation (22 tasks)

Tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1], [US2], [US3]. Each task specifies exact file paths and requirements including learning objectives, conceptual explanations, forward references, and key takeaways while preserving frontmatter and avoiding code blocks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for textbook content generation
- 🧪 Tests: Task completeness and dependency mapping validated
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with structured implementation plan
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation (/sp.implement)
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story priority with parallel execution opportunities

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all tasks properly formatted and organized
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all tasks follow required format
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Task breakdown prompt
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of tasks
